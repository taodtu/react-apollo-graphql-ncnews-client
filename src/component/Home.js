   <li>Data manipulations on array and object are ensured <strong>not mutating</strong> the original data by using destructuring and spread operator.</li>
   <li>Embrace <strong>declarative data fetching</strong> using Apollo built-in Query/Mutation component with <strong>Render Props</strong> Pattern.</li>
   <li>All graphQL mutations are achieved using <strong>Apollo Cache</strong>, rather than refetching from the server after mutation.</li>
   <li><strong>Optimistic response</strong> is implemented on article vote button.</li>
   <li><strong>Prefetching data</strong> is applied on Topic/User list item. So the articles data is fetched and stored in cache when mouse is hovering on it, and show immediately when user click. This feature is not working on Mobile device while no onMouseOver is enabled.</li>
