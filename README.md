## Features

All the data manipulations on array and object are ensured not mutating the original data by using destructuring and spread operator.

`Offset-based pagination` is implemented on topics and users page, while `cursor-based pagination` is applied on articles page.

All graphQL mutations are achieved using `Apollo Cache`, rather than refetching from the server after mutation.
